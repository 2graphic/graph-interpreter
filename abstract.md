Sinap will be a pluggable IDE for domain-specific graph-based languages (DGSLs). It will allow users to create graphical programs within these languages and for developers to easily create new DGSLs. Sinap will be a fully-featured IDE including an editor, interactive prompt, debugger, and test suite. In addition to the base IDE, we will develop two suites of plug-ins. The FLAP plug-ins (Formal Languages and Automata Package) will be suitable for students in a models of computation class (and will have a similar feature set to JFLAP). The machine learning plugin will allow for rapid prototyping of deep neural network architectures and will have an interface similar to Keras.
